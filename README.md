# Firebase Transaction Race Condition and Silent Failure

This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked issue in Firebase Cloud Firestore: silent failures in transactions due to race conditions and inadequate error handling.

## Problem
The provided `bug.js` showcases a simple counter increment using `FieldValue.increment()`.  While functional under low load, it fails silently under high concurrency. Multiple clients attempting to increment the counter simultaneously may experience unexpected behavior as only some updates may succeed, leading to inconsistencies and unpredictable state. The lack of comprehensive error handling means these failures are not readily apparent to the developer.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a robust solution by incorporating proper transaction handling. It includes a retry mechanism and informative error reporting to ensure data integrity and operational awareness.

## Setup
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Set up a Firebase project and obtain the necessary credentials.  Update `firebase.initializeApp()` accordingly.
3.  Run `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` separately to observe the difference in behavior under concurrent access (you can simulate this using multiple browser tabs or scripts).

## Lessons Learned
- Always utilize transactions appropriately for data integrity, particularly with concurrent updates.
- Implement comprehensive error handling to catch and react to unexpected issues, like aborted transactions.
- Consider retry mechanisms for transactions to handle temporary failures gracefully.
